## COLM 2025 specific info

[COLM 2025](https://colmweb.org/) will happen from October 7th to 10th at the [Palais des Congrès](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2KBzjB32JPW4WBkh8) in Downtown Montréal. In our opinion, this is the least interesting part of Montréal (but at least you're very close to Montréal's most famous church, Notre-Dame!). Luckily, the Palais des Congrès is connected to the Place-d'Armes metro station (orange line), so it is very easy to explore the city from there. Most of our recommendations are in other parts of the city (Plateau, Mile-End, and Little Italy) and we highly recommend leaving downtown to discover the true Montréal :).

That said, for those of you who prefer spending their lunch break not too far away from the venue, below is a list of places in reasonable distance from the Palais des Congrès.

- [Café Paquebot Vieux-Montréal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vKCNA6MrPuJEiKVf8): Old Montréal branch of café paquebot.
- [Fleurs et Cadeaux](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sUMTXwc5WiuPNs756): Amazing Japanese restaurant.
- Chinatown is just a few minutes away by walk. Our recs there are: [Nouilles de Lan Zhou](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aQ3QfvDTvNdZ2gWo8), [La Toxica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oV86RgCY3NUj1LHt5), [La Capital](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UjXh5y8gk1yED3q19), [Sammi & Soupe Dumpling](https://maps.app.goo.gl/apPpRtV9mj14K5JS8), and [Pâtisserie Coco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dX6sAmy9QseQr5PR9).
- [LE CENTRAL](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dYEvsageEpcccKh27): Food court just outside of Chinatown.
- [Neotokyo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nagME6nf4k7B1ovg9): Solid Ramen place.

### Bagels

- [Fairmount Bagel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K3wBonNEYAmaypHj6): Arguably the best bagel place in town. There is a huge rivalry with the slightly more famous St Viateur.
