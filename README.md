## COLM 2025 specific info

[COLM 2025](https://colmweb.org/) will happen from October 7th to 10th at the [Palais des Congrès](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2KBzjB32JPW4WBkh8) in Downtown Montréal. In my opinion (Marius), this is the least interesting part of Montréal. Luckily, the Palais des Congrès is connected to the Place-d'Armes metro station (orange line), so it will be easy to explore the city from there. At least you're very close to Montreal's most famous church, Notre-Dame!

## Getting around

- [Bixi](https://bixi.com/en/): Bixi is a bicycle sharing system in the metropolitan are of Montréal. It's a great way to explore the city. Make sure to download and setup the app beforehand.
- [STM](https://www.stm.info/en): STM is the public transport agency in Montréal. They operate busses and Montréal metro. See here for [fares](https://www.stm.info/en/info/fares/transit-fares). You can buy tickets at ticket machines inside the metro stations using cash or credit cards.
- Walking. Montréal is a very walkable city. We highly recommend walking around it's many great neighborhoods.

## Food


### Bakeries

### Bagels

- [Fairmount Bagel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K3wBonNEYAmaypHj6): Arguably the best bagel place in town. There is a huge rivalry with the slightly more famous St Viateur. But we are loyal to Fairmount bagels! It is open 24/7, so get oven-fresh bagels after a long night out! This institution of Montreal culture is surrounded by two other iconic places: Gnocchi and Kem Coba (ice cream). Paying by cash is recommended. +5% fee for using a credit card.
- [St-Viateur Bagel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tufpCjcKPkJFLEdz5): The other famous bagel bakery in Montréal. They also have a café on Rue Mont Royal (very long line on the weekend). They also have a [café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zLywjdL8pChoGCzL8) on Rue Mont Royal.
